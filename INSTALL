Important Note For Users Upgrading From Earlier Versions
--------------------------------------------------------

SpamAssassin no longer includes code to handle local mail delivery, as it
was not reliable enough, compared to procmail.  So now, if you relied on
spamassassin to write the mail into your mail folder, you'll have to
change your setup to use procmail as detailed below.

If you used spamassassin to filter your mail and then something else wrote
it into a folder for you, then you should be fine.

Also note that SpamAssassin now uses Berkeley DB files for it's
auto-whitelist database by default; on some platforms, you may find
that your old auto-whitelist is now ignored.


Installing SpamAssassin
-----------------------

The easiest way to do this is using CPAN.pm, like so:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell                    [as root]
	o conf prerequisites_policy ask
	install Mail::SpamAssassin
	quit

On Debian, you can apt-get it from unstable, thanks to Duncan Findlay.

Alternatively download the tarfile, zipfile or Red Hat RPM from
http://spamassassin.org/ , and install that, like so:

	[unzip/untar the archive]
	cd Mail-SpamAssassin-*
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install				[as root]

To install as non-root, do something like this:

	[unzip/untar the archive]
	cd Mail-SpamAssassin-*
	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/sausr SYSCONFDIR=~/saetc
	make
	make install

This will install the SpamAssassin modules and rules into the ~/sausr
and ~/saetc directories off your home directory.


SunOS Note
----------

Under SunOS, snprintf is not defined.  A library containing a SunOS
version of snprintf is included in contrib/snp.tar.gz, and that should be
useable for building SA.  If you're a SunOS user and do this, and would
like to document the process for others, please send the docs to the SA
maintainer to amend these basic directions.


Installing SpamAssassin for Personal Use (Not System-Wide)
----------------------------------------------------------

These steps assume the following, so substitute as necessary:
  - Your UNIX login is "user"
  - Your home directory is /home/user
  - The location of the procmail executable is /usr/bin/procmail

1. Uncompress and extract the SpamAssassin archive, using "unzip" or "tar
xvfz", in a temporary directory.

2. change directory into it:

	cd Mail-SpamAssassin-*

3. Make SpamAssassin as normal, but using your home directory as the
target:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/sausr SYSCONFDIR=~/saetc
	make
	make install

4. If you already use procmail, skip to step 6.  If not, ensure procmail
is installed using "which procmail" or install it from www.procmail.org.

5. Create a .forward file in your home directory containing the below
lines:

"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #user"

6. Edit or create a .procmailrc file in your home directory containing the
below lines.  If you already have a .procmailrc file, add the lines to the
top of your .procmailrc file:

:0fw
| /home/user/sausr/bin/spamassassin

The above line filters all incoming mail through SpamAssassin and tags
probable spam with a unique header.  If you would prefer to have spam
blocked and saved to a file called "caughtspam" in your home directory,
instead of passed through and tagged, append this directly below the above
lines:

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
caughtspam

7. Now, you should be ready to send some test emails and ensure everything
works as expected.  First, send yourself a test email that doesn't contain
anything suspicious.  You should receive it normally, but there will be a
header containing "X-Spam-Status: No".  If you are only tagging your spam,
send yourself an obvious spam mail and check to be sure it is marked as
spam.  If your test emails don't get through to you, immediately rename
your .forward file until you figure out cause of the the problem, so you
don't lose incoming email.


Required Modules
----------------

These modules are required for spamassassin to run.

  - File::Spec >= 0.8    (from CPAN, or included in Perl 5.6 and higher)

    The File::Spec module is required in version 0.8 (Mar 2000) or later.
    This is included in Perl versions 5.6 and later.

  - Pod::Usage           (from CPAN, or included in Perl 5.6 and higher)

    The Pod::Usage module is required.  This is included in Perl versions
    5.6 and later.

  - HTML::Parser >= 3.0  (from CPAN)

    HTML is used for an ever-increasing amount of email so this dependency
    is unavoidable.  Run "perldoc -q html" for additional information.

    If you use Debian, you can get HTML::Parser from the libhtml-parser-perl
    package.

Optional Additional Modules
---------------------------

In addition, the following modules will be used for some checks, if
available.  If they are not available, SpamAssassin will still work, just
not as effectively -- some of the spam-detection tests will have to be
skipped.


  - Net::DNS	(from CPAN)

    Used to check the RBL, RSS, DUL etc. and perform MX checks.
    Recommended.

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	o conf prerequisites_policy ask
	install Net::DNS
	quit


  - Razor	http://razor.sourceforge.net/

    Used to check message signatures against Vipul's Razor collaborative
    filtering network.  Razor is not available from CPAN -- you have to
    download it from the URL above.

    Razor has a large number of dependencies on CPAN modules.  Feel free
    to skip installing it, if this makes you nervous; SpamAssassin will
    still work well without it.
    

  - DCC    http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/

    DCC (Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse) is a system similar to Razor.
    It supports fuzzy checksums and therefore detects some more spams than
    Razor does at the moment.

    To install it, download
    http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/source/dcc-dccproc.tar.Z and
    perform the following steps:

    # tar xfvz dcc-dccproc.tar.Z
    # cd dcc-dccproc-X.X.X
    # ./configure && make && make install
    # cdcc 'info'

    The last command will give some output. One line of it should contain
    something like:

        dcc.rhyolite.com,-         RTT+0 ms    anon


  - Pyzor    http://pyzor.sourceforge.net/

    Used to check message signatures against the Pyzor collaborative
    filtering network.  Pyzor was initially "a Python implementation of
    Razor", but now also uses its own (free) server architecture and is
    "based upon a new, lighter, more language-independent protocol."

    Pyzor requires at least Python 2.2.1 which can be found at
    http://www.python.org/ .
 
    To install Pyzor, download the latest revision from
    https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50000 and
    perform the following steps:

        # bunzip2 pyzor-*.tar.bz2
        # cd pyzor-*
        # python setup.py build
        # python setup.py install

    Note that your system might install the modules and scripts with
    non-world-readable permissions.  Correct this with a command such as:

	# chmod -R a+rX /usr/share/doc/pyzor \
		/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/pyzor \
		/usr/bin/pyzor /usr/bin/pyzord

   Read the INSTALL document if you want to setup your own Pyzor server and
   signature store.  Otherwise, you can just use the public servers.


  - Mail::Audit, Mail::Internet, Net::SMTP	(from CPAN)

    If you want to use SpamAssassin with Mail::Audit, you will (obviously)
    require the Mail::Audit module, and any modules it requires (there's
    lots of them, unfortunately).
    
    Additionally, Mail::Internet is required if you wish to use the
    "-r/-w" options of the spamassassin program (reporting and replying,
    for spam-trap mail accounts).

    If you use procmail, KMail, 'spamassassin', or you plan to use
    'spamd', you will *not* need these.

    Here's how to install them using CPAN.pm:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	o conf prerequisites_policy ask
	install Mail::Audit
	quit

  - Digest::SHA1  (from CPAN)

    The Digest::SHA1 module will speed up some cryptographic hash tests,
    but is not required (although it may be required by another module).

    If you use Debian, you can get Digest::SHA1 from the libdigest-sha1-perl
    package.

Using SpamAssassin
------------------

Steps to take for every installation:

  - Install Mail::SpamAssassin on your mail server, as above.

  - Test it:

      spamassassin -t < sample-nonspam.txt > nonspam.out
      spamassassin -t < sample-spam.txt > spam.out

    Verify (using a text viewer, ie. "less" or "notepad") that nonspam.out
    has not been tagged as spam, and that spam.out has.  The files should
    contain the full text and headers of the messages, the "spam.out"
    message should be annotated with "****SPAM****" in the subject line
    and a report from SpamAssassin, and there should be no errors when you
    run the commands.

    Even though sample-nonspam.txt is not spam, nonspam.out will contain a
    SpamAssassin report anyway.  This is a side-effect of the "-t" (test)
    switch.  However, there should be less than 5 hits accumulated; when
    the "-t" switch is not in use, the report text would not be added.

    If the commands do not work, DO NOT PROCEED TO THE NEXT STEP, as you
    will lose mail!



If you use Mail::Audit already:

  - run "perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin" and take a look at the synopsis, it
    outlines what you need to add to your audit script.

  - Copy the configuration files (see CUSTOMISING, below) to a known
    location, so your script can set the appropriate options for the
    Mail::SpamAssassin constructor to load them.



If you use KMail:

  - http://kmail.kde.org/tools.html mentions:

    The filter setup is the work of five minutes (if that!) if you have a
    working spamassassin set up.

    The filter in question is "<any header><matches regexp> ."

    The action is "<pipe through> spamassassin"

    Then, in the advanced options, uncheck the "If this filter matches,
    stop processing here" box. If you keep this filter at the top, it will
    analyze any incoming mail, decide whether it's spam or not, and flag
    it accordingly.

    [Then add] a second filter behind it, which searches for the added
    spam-flags and diverts them into a specific spam folder. [...]



If you use procmail, or haven't decided on any of the above examples:

  - Make a backup of your .procmailrc (if you already have one).

      cp ~/.procmailrc ~/.procmailrc.bak

  - add the line from procmailrc.example to ~/.procmailrc, at the top of
    the file before any existing recipes.

    That'll process all mail through SA, and refile spam messages to
    a folder called "caughtspam" in your home directory.

  - Send yourself a mail message, and ensure it gets to you.  If it does
    not, copy your old backed-up .procmailrc file back into place and ask
    your sysadmin for help!  Here's commands to do that:

      cp ~/.procmailrc.bak ~/.procmailrc
      echo "Help!" | mail root



If you want to use SpamAssassin site-wide:

  - take a look at the notes on the website, at
    http://spamassassin.org/sitewide.html .  You will probably want to use
    'spamd' (see below).

  - Note that procmail users adding spamc to /etc/procmailrc should 
    add the line 'DROPPRIVS=yes' at the top of the file.



Other installation notes:

  - SpamAssassin now uses a temporary file in /tmp (or $TMPDIR, if that's
    set in the environment) for Pyzor and DCC checks.  Make sure that this
    directory is not either (a) writable by other users, or (b) shared over
    NFS, for security.


  - The auto-whitelist is enabled using the -a flag to spamassassin or
    spamd.


  - spamc can now be built as a shared library for use with milters or
    to link into other existing programs; simply run "make libspamc.so"
    to build this.


  - If you get spammed, it is helpful to everyone else if you re-run
    spamassassin with the "-r" option to report the message in question as
    "verified spam".  This will add it to Vipul's Razor
    (http://razor.sourceforge.net/), a collaborative spam filtering
    network, if you've installed the Razor modules.

      spamassassin -r < spam-message

    If you use mutt as your mail reader, this macro will bind the X key to
    report a spam message.

      macro index X "| spamassassin -r"

    This is, of course, optional -- but you'll get lots of good-netizen
    karma. ;)


  - Quite often, if you've been on the internet for a while, you'll have
    accumulated a few old email accounts that nowadays get nothing but
    spam.  You can set these up as spam traps using SpamAssassin; see the
    ''SPAM TRAPPING'' section of the spamassassin manual page for details.

    If you don't want to go to the bother of setting up a system yourself
    to do this, feel free to set up a simple alias to forward any mails to
    <someaddress@spamtraps.taint.org> -- replace "someaddress" with
    something to identify you, such as your email addr or website with
    non-alphanumeric chars replaced by underscores, or similar.   This
    will feed it into my spam-trapping system running on taint.org, where
    it will be fed into Razor.


  - The distribution now includes 'spamd', a daemonized version of the
    perl script, and 'spamc', a low-overhead C client for this,
    contributed by Craig R. Hughes.  This greatly reduces the overhead of
    checking large volumes of mail with SpamAssassin.  Take a look in the
    'spamd' directory for more details.


  - Scores and other user preferences can now be loaded from an SQL
    database; see the 'sql' subdirectory for more details.


  - Edward Fang <edfang /at/ visi.net> has contributed the
    'communigate.sh' script for CommunigatePro (see the 'contrib'
    directory).


  - James Henstridge <james /at/ daa.com.au> has contributed an LMTP proxy
    server (designed for Cyrus, but probably will work fine with others),
    again it's in the contrib directory.
