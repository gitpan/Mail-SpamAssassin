2003-02-18 17:47  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: All of the bayes_* files

	tools/check_bayes_db: bug 1460: bayes_expiry_use_scan_count is now
	the default, using a method that should not be much slower than
	using the time.  This now means that expiry can take place during a
	mass-check, which is very important.  Implementation uses a
	separate file, bayes_msgcount, to track scan-count.  This will not
	require rescanning the bayes dbs.

2003-02-14 21:10  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: Fixed up the
	dcc/pyzor debugging statements

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Reporter.pm: Need to clean up after the tmp
	file ...

2003-02-07 19:15  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Dns.pm, Reporter.pm: cleaned up a few
	things in dns.	cleaned up a _lot_ of stuff in reporter.  while
	working on a fix for bug 1447 I found that it was just easier to
	clean things up and fix it at the same time.  reporter now calls
	some code directly in dns to avoid the "one gets updated without
	the other one" problem we keep having...  Report and check are
	still seperate, but the *_available code is now the same.  Reporter
	also does helper_mode now (which fixed the tainted path issue).
	
	I've tested against razor and dcc and they seem to work fine.  I
	don't have pyzor installed, but since dcc works I don't see why
	pyzor wouldn't ...

	So now I reverted to the code that did work, tested it, and am now
	committing it.	Somebody please slap me around for doing this ...

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Conf.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm: Fix for bug
	1400.  If a rule was defined with no score, only a single scoreset
	would get a score set for it.  We now set a score for all scoresets

2003-01-21 16:09  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Conf.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm: autolearning
	will now only take place with scoresets 0 and 1.  if we're using 2
	or 3, the autolearn code will revert to 0 or 1 and recompute the
	score, then check about autolearning.  this gives us consistency in
	autolearning on the same scoresets all the time.

2003-01-19 05:59  felicity

	* masses/corpora/remove-tests-from-logs: take a -t option to

	keep X months.

2002-12-31 19:37  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: parse eval options at
	parse time instead of run-time (5.5% speed-up)

2002-12-31 19:37  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: change test types to constants
	(odd-numbered ones are now evals too) change some '-' characters in
	option names to '_' characters to be more consistent parse eval
	options at parse time instead of run-time (5.5% speed-up) reorder
	if/elsif during finish_parsing a bit for somewhat better speed
	(order by frequency of test, probably not a noticeable difference)
	use tr// in two places instead of s//

2002-12-31 19:31  quinlan

	* rules/10_misc.cf: change some '-' characters to be '_' for better

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm: Found more "close
	STDIN" statements with the next call too -- replaced as per last
	commit.

2002-12-30 14:34  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm: Fix for bug 1325, we
	don't need to close STDIN so don't. ;) Also, there's a next call
	where there's no context for a next, so perl (5.8.0 at least)
	treats it as a return, so just call return.

2002-12-30 06:08  quinlan

	* rules/20_html_tests.cf: remove HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_14

2002-12-30 01:40  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: the razor2 problem seemed to be
	related to having a dos formatted file.  razor-check doesn't seem
	to have any issues checking it, but through spamassassin, razor
	would see 1 big header.  the solution is to replace the lf/cr/lf
	combo with just lf/lf.	That makes the blank line between header
	and body blank, and razor works nicely for SA then.

2002-12-30 01:15  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: There seem to be sometimes where
	Razor2 doesn't think it gets a request, and therefore doesn't set
	'spam' properly leading to an undefined warning further down the
	code.  Until I can track down the problem, I've put in a kluge
	which basically just sets the result to 0 if it's undefined.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, rules/20_body_tests.cf,
	rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: generalize most of the
	check_for_mime tests (most of the functions are not needed) add
	T_MIME_DEFICIENT_QP rule (rule I had discarded earlier because it
	did not work well, but should work better now that the MIME QP code
	has been improved, it's also only a few lines of code now) also
	organize the MIME rules a bit

2002-12-29 00:08  felicity

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: Per bug 1316, it looks like
	mutt has a standard format to message-id.  I added a test meta rule
	to look for both the user-agent and message-id headers for
	USER_AGENT.  Also added a forged_mua rule to look for user-agent
	without message-id.  This doesn't score so well, but...

	* rules/: 20_body_tests.cf, 20_head_tests.cf, 20_uri_tests.cf,
	70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: Test rule cleaning: promoted BODY_8BITS
	promoted FROM_HAS_UNDERLINE_NUMS promoted BARGAIN_URL added

2002-12-28 19:13  felicity

	* rules/: 20_anti_ratware.cf, 20_compensate.cf,
	70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: Added a T_FAKE_USER_AGENT that goes off

	figure out the dependencies and run the metas in the right order. 
	If a dependency on another meta rule can't be solved (ie: circular
	dependency), the rule is skipped and a debug message is displayed
	(if debugging is enabled).
	
	So: meta BB AA && CC meta AA HEAD1 && CC meta CC HEAD2
	
	Although contrived, the code will make sure to run CC, then AA,
	then BB.
	
	However: meta AA BB meta BB AA
	
	Causes both rules to be skipped.

	replacement meta rule to see if we can clear it up.  DEAR_SOMEBODY
	has a fairly bad S/O rating anyway, so we may just end up removing
	it.
	
	WEIRD_PORT hits
	http://www.cnn.com:USArticle1840@www.liquidshirts.com/ which
	actually doesn't have a port specified in it.  Put in a possible
	replacement rule to avoid the fps.
	
	bug 1273: the above URL wasn't caught, so I put in a test rule to
	check for a username and/or password in uris.

2002-12-24 02:54  felicity

2002-12-23 22:36  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Thought
	of a new solution to the bayes getting false message-id during
	encapsulated reporting and such -- take the message-id and put it
	in the encapsulated header.  The correct message-id will be used,
	and then pre-learning the message is cleaned as before.

	avoiding my fps

2002-12-23 14:09  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Use a private variable to

	go with my previous commit for some reason. :(

2002-12-23 14:08  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: If you change the content-type or
	content-description of the mime encapsulated spam mail part, you
	need to change it in remove_spamassassin_markup as well.  We don't
	have any other tell-tale markup saying it's an encapsulated
	message, so the code keys in on the two content-* headers.
	
	Added a private configuration setting in SpamAssassin.pm which lets
	us change the description in one place and have it used in
	(de)encapsulation.

	dies horribly (if the nameserver(s) listed in resolv.conf don't
	work, for instance,) so is_dns_available will now deal with this
	situation in conjunction with lookup_mx.  lookup_ptr (used by an
	EvalTest) just returns undef which is already an understood return
	value.

	interact with RAZOR2_CHECK since that should take into account the
	user's min_cf setting, but ...
	
	Remove some useless $fulltext stuff w/ Razor1 and 2 as well (why
	set the variable if you're not going to use it?)
	
	For a random 10 spam sample that I received today:
	
	      8 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_90_100
	      1 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_80_89
	      1 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_00_09
	
	So 80% had a super confidence level, 10% was very high, and 10% was
	very low.
	
	The default for users, BTW, is a min_cf setting of 1.

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: Added T_USER_AGENT to try and

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm: Changed if to elsif since the
	previous if could unset the variable that the second would check. 
	It also properly has the last elsif now. :)

2002-10-17 15:02  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, masses/mass-check:
	nonsense_from_percent() returned "true" if the names-triplets.txt
	file couldn't be found which is the same as "rule matches".  Change
	it to return "false" instead so we don't FP if we can't read the
	file.
	
	nonsense_from_percent() used rules_filename which isn't likely to
	be set in an actual run.  Converted it to use DEF_RULES_DIR and
	LOCAL_RULES_DIR like the other EvalTests since it's guaranteed to
	be set.
	
	mass-check wasn't setting DEF_RULES_DIR and LOCAL_RULES_DIR (and
	PREFIX) which breaks EvalTests...

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Dns.pm, Reporter.pm: Razor2 calls
	Net::Ping which uses alarm() to timeout.  Unfortunately that kills
	our timeout alarm() for the Razor2 calls.  Doh!  Added in alarms
	after the get_server_info() call (the one that calls Net::Ping) to
	reset our timeout.  It's not great, but I think it'll stop the
	"razor check/report hangs" type problem.

	* spamproxy/spamproxyd.raw: Patched spamproxyd.raw to specify a
	maximum message size.  The patch and new version wasn't very
	different but the whitespace was all changed around, so it looked
	like a lot more work.  Since so much had been changed already, I
	ran the resulting code through "perltidy -i=2".
	
	I also modified the code to be a bit more efficient:	- instead
	of doing a split(/\r\n/) then adding the \r\n back in,		I
	changed it to split(/^/).   - Code around if/else statements were
	duplicated, so I rewrote	    it to only run the code once.

	Razor2 reporting now returns a valid return code  -
