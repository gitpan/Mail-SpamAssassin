2003-09-23 00:08  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 2491: 1)
	the learn_to_journal option was only good for autolearning and
	using sa-learn, but "spamassassin -r" just went r/w all the time.
	
	2) when running from spamassassin, caller_will_untie was false.  so
	when learn() called forget(), forget() would untie, thereby leaving
	learn() screwed.  this was generating the undefined warnings since
	the untie() cleared db_version.  so we kluge around that by
	saving/setting caller_will_untie, then restoring after the
	forget().
	
	3) forget() didn't know it could "learn to journal", so it always
	went r/w.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Util.pm: bug 2450: when SA previously
	detected that it's in taint mode, it would reset PATH to a known
	string (/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/lcoal/bin).	There were a few problems
	with this however, 1) that negates any special dirs that the
	admin/user needed in PATH (dccproc, etc,) 2) That's a UNIX-centric
	path, it doesn't work on Windows/etc.
	
	So not only should we go through and just untaint the dirs in PATH
	(verify they exist, that they're not relative, etc,) and also make
	sure when we finalize PATH, it uses the appropriate path seperator
	as configured in perl.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 2216: The Bayes expiry
	code didn't take into account that expiring at 12 hours could
	expire too many tokens so none of the time choices would be valid. 
	This caused the "should I abort?" if() statement to not work
	correctly.
	
	Also, Bayes expiry is limited to once every 12 hours for normal
	usage, but during a mass-check an expiry would occur whenever
	necessary.  Unfortunately, if an expiry attempt didn't expire
	enough tokens, the next message would do another expiry run, and so
	on until it could finally remove enough tokens.  Since this is
	horribly slow and inefficient, mass-check now has a limit of one
	expiry every 5 minutes.

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm,
	SpamAssassin/CmdLearn.pm, SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: bug 2154: 1)
	sa-learn called init, which called init_learner with the config
	options.  for me, this enabled learn to journal.      cmdlearn then
	called init_learner with the appropriate options for forget (don't
	learn to journal), except that init_learner only can enable, not
	disable options.  so we always learned to the journal.	see #2.
	
	2) during a forget (which can be called when we're learning an
	already learned message as a different type as well), we didn't
	update the journal.
	
	3) auto_learn_journal is a minomer since all learning goes to the
	journal.
	
	so: we now allow init_learner to enable or disable options
	depending on true/false values, we rename auto_learn_to_journal to
	just be learn_to_journal, and forget now will update the journal if
	necessary.

	is true only where an OS error happened. However, in the SSL world,
	!$client can also happen where the SSL negotiation failed, which
	does not imply an OS error and the consequent setting of errno.
	
	The attached patch detects this; if SSL is set and errno is zero,
	then we log the fact that there must've been an SSL error, and we
	don't allow ourselves to be die()d.

2003-05-11 00:29  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1888: the expiry system
	tries to figure out if the new expire is largely different from the
	last expire.  if they are, there was probably a surge at some point
	and it would make a bad estimation for this expire, so it'll
	recompute atime delta.	but 0 is a valid last expire count (new
	db), so we got a div by zero error. :(
	
	changed expiry_due to check for >100000 tokens.  if there were
	exactly 100k tokens, and we did the expire, it would get confused
	because to leave 100k tokens in the db (safety), we would want to

	if we couldn't find a good exponent to expire from in the first

	had a stupid bug where expiry would expire to 100000 if it wanted

	symbol. ;) (it now says keep 100k if the "to expire to" point is <
	100k, which is the correct logic...)
	
	added a "need to do first pass" check if the last expire count is
	0.  whenever that happens, last atime delta should also be 0, and
	that's already checked, but ...

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm: bug 1664: the
	only entries in the bayes journal are token access time updates
	(from scans).  we can exploit the fact that most of the tokens
	appear multiple times by caching in memory the updates per token,
	then just writing to db the end result times for all tokens.  
	also, scan() tries to opportunistically do a journal sync and
	expire which causes lots of contention if there is a lot of
	messages for a single db (this is usually seen with site-wide dbs).
	 so we flag when we are doing the sync and expire and let all other
	pids not be so opportunistic.  this should greatly lower
	contention.  we also let the db tie r/w happen before we try to
	read from the journal, and also exploit the fact we can open the
	journal before renaming it so the most common error occurs first,
	and then a journal read failure means we don't need to rename the
	temp file back.

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm,

	bug 1591:  Bayes is_available() didn't pay attention to use_bayes,
	so it would still attempt a tie and possibly create DBs even if it
	wasn't going to use the bayes stuff.  renamed the function to
	is_scan_available() since other modules call it to see if a scan
	would be done (determining scoreset, etc.)  cleaned up scan() a
	little (let is_scan_available check for # of tokens)

	being copied over.  oops.  also added checks for return values to
	make sure we don't delete the journal unless we really should. 
	modified expiry_due to do an expire if the last expire time is >
	current message scan.  this should never happen in actual usage and

	call is_scan_available (checked to tie the DB, enough tokens, etc.)

2003-03-03 19:07  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Don't run eval rules from

	local_tests_only and the like.

	moment it's easier to work around their issue then to explain to
	all the users why it's RPM's fault, so that's why the SA RPM
	doesn't build right.

2003-02-24 03:18  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/NoMailAudit.pm: fix for bug 1544.  add
	option to _get_header_list to retrieve header names that match case
	insensitively instead of just returning the values from all of
	those same headers.  instead of replace_header seeing if there are
	versions that need to be removed, just call delete_header and it'll
	figure it out.	delete_header now removes all case insensitive
	matches (via _get_header_list) of a header instead of the case
	sensitive match.  according to rfc2822, header names are case
	insensitive so we should deal with that appropriately.

	')'...	disabled for now.

	the default, using a method that should not be much slower than

	some code directly in dns to avoid the "one gets updated without
	the other one" problem we keep having...  Report and check are
	still seperate, but the *_available code is now the same.  Reporter
	also does helper_mode now (which fixed the tainted path issue).
	
	I've tested against razor and dcc and they seem to work fine.  I
	don't have pyzor installed, but since dcc works I don't see why

	ham hits than spam hits ...

2003-01-24 16:38  felicity

	* spamassassin.raw: warn about -S in spamassassin too

2003-01-24 16:37  felicity

	* spamd/spamd.raw: we should only warn people that -S was removed,
	don't die yet

2003-01-24 15:57  msquadrat

	fff.at

2003-01-23 10:56  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: avoid 'argument '' isn't
	numeric in addition' warning

2003-01-23 04:12  felicity

2003-01-23 00:58  jmason

	* spamd/: libspamc.c, libspamc.h, spamc.c, utils.c, utils.h: bug
	1212: spamc -t timeout code from eugene AT invision.net

2003-01-22 15:06  jmason

2003-01-22 14:35  jmason

	* spamd/libspamc.c: reworked the failover-fix code a little to
	avoid coredump reported by Malte

2003-01-21 22:15  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Conf.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm: Fix for bug
	1400.  If a rule was defined with no score, only a single scoreset
	would get a score set for it.  We now set a score for all scoresets
	unless one is currently defined.  Changed the autolearn code back
	to not checking for existence.

2003-01-21 21:48  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: For some stupid reason,
	scoresets may have different rules from each other, so we need to
	check for existence. :(

2003-01-21 21:02  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: give debug info if we can't use a
	bayes db due to insufficient messages

2003-01-21 19:38  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: always_add_report should be 0, not
	1 by default

2003-01-21 19:36  felicity

	* rules/23_bayes.cf: a bunch of BAYES rules didn't have tflags
	learn ...

2003-01-21 18:44  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: let autolearn ignore
	userconf too

2003-01-21 18:08  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Code skips 0 score sets in
	autolearning We now ignore tflag "learn" rules in autolearning
	instead of /BAYES/

2003-01-21 17:57  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm: leftover crud. sorry
	about that

2003-01-21 17:33  jmason

	* sa-learn-nonspam.raw, lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm,
	lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm,
	lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm,
	masses/corpora/mass-find-nonspam: added always_add_report param,
	patch from sabat (sabat /at/ eloan /dot/ com)

2003-01-21 16:09  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Conf.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm: autolearning
	will now only take place with scoresets 0 and 1.  if we're using 2
	or 3, the autolearn code will revert to 0 or 1 and recompute the
	score, then check about autolearning.  this gives us consistency in
	autolearning on the same scoresets all the time.

2003-01-21 15:13  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: Updated scores after set1 run

2003-01-21 01:55  felicity

	* rules/20_head_tests.cf: whitelists are supposed to be nice!

2003-01-21 01:37  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: setup for set1 GA run

2003-01-21 01:36  felicity

	* masses/corpora/remove-tests-from-logs, rules/20_head_tests.cf:
	fixing some stuff to remove tests, X_OSIRU_DUL_FH is supposed to be
	nice

2003-01-20 19:54  felicity

	* masses/: hit-frequencies, lint-rules-from-freqs: More work to
	make net tests mutable if we're doing a net test (scoreset%2 == 1)

2003-01-20 19:40  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: GA set0 scores > 4.8 brought down to 4.0
	(except those that are very unlikely to FP)

2003-01-20 19:28  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: GA scored set 0

2003-01-20 19:05  jmason

	* spamd/libspamc.c: struct hostent was overwritten in syslog call
	so failover was not working; now fixed, I think

2003-01-20 18:52  felicity

	* masses/Makefile: Makefile now knows about scoresets.	Do a "make
	SCORESET=#" or it'll default to 0.

2003-01-20 18:46  felicity

	* masses/logs-to-c: put back includes, lets evolve compile on
	macosx. :(

2003-01-20 16:50  felicity

	* masses/score-ranges-from-freqs: make net tests mutable if
	scoreset indicates a net run

2003-01-20 15:49  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, masses/hit-frequencies,
	masses/logs-to-c, masses/parse-rules-for-masses,
	masses/score-ranges-from-freqs: Comment out CARRIAGE_RETURN eval
	code.  masses code now understands scoresets, at least enough. :)

2003-01-20 01:47  felicity

	* rules/: 20_body_tests.cf, 30_text_fr.cf, 50_scores.cf,
	70_broken_rules.cf: got rid of CARRIAGE_RETURNS

2003-01-19 20:23  felicity

	* masses/corpora/remove-tests-from-logs: fixed a few more bugs

2003-01-19 19:50  felicity

	* masses/corpora/remove-tests-from-logs: fixed the code some more
	to deal with -t option

2003-01-19 17:28  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: boo boo with HABEAS_SWE

2003-01-19 05:59  felicity

	* masses/corpora/remove-tests-from-logs: take a -t option to
	specify a timestamp.  rule removal will only happen up to that
	timestamp.  this is useful for net tests where you only want to
	keep X months.

2003-01-19 05:20  felicity

	* masses/mass-check: total_check wasn't being incremented before
	progress, so at 100% done, we were one off. :(

2003-01-19 04:25  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: BayesStore.pm, Conf.pm,
	DBBasedAddrList.pm, NoMailAudit.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm, Util.pm: Put
	umask around any open or tie commands.	This will 1) let the *_mode
	options work as expected, and 2) keep some of our temp files more
	secure.

2003-01-19 00:56  felicity

	* masses/score-ranges-from-freqs: it didn't know how to deal with
	multiple scoresets, so I let it default to set0

2003-01-19 00:41  felicity

	* rules/: 20_compensate.cf, 20_head_tests.cf, 20_phrases.cf,
	20_ratware.cf, 20_uri_tests.cf, 50_scores.cf, 70_broken_rules.cf:
	pushed rules to 70_broken from the first 2.50 mass-check with bad
	results.

2003-01-18 22:40  felicity

	* rules/20_compensate.cf: [no log message]

2003-01-18 20:58  felicity

	* rules/: 20_meta_tests.cf, 20_phrases.cf: NMS_CGI_NOT_BUGGY wasn't
	hitting anything, so I made it part of a meta rule with BUGGY_CGI
	per suggestion from eallen.

2003-01-18 16:51  felicity

	* masses/: craig-evolve.c, logs-to-c: Applied Allen's GA patches
	from bug 1088.

	coming for 2.60)

2003-01-18 06:19  felicity

	* masses/hit-frequencies: hit-frequencies doesn't know what to do
	with multiple scoresets, so I let it default to scoreset 0...

2003-01-18 06:08  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: setting pre-GA scores for bayes and net tests

2003-01-17 01:45  felicity

	* masses/mass-check: $date is passed undef to progress, so I added
	in a "set to 0 if undefined" to at least stop the warning. 
	$total_count is set to 0 in the parent, then each child increases
	their copy, then the parent calls progress which still sees
	$total_count==0.  So I moved the increment into the parent.

2003-01-16 20:28  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: added a debug statement in case the
	object format changes incompatibly again

2003-01-16 20:22  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Dns.pm, EvalTests.pm: Fixed up Razor2
	check code some more.  We now support both razor object layouts
	(<2.14 and >=2.14).  Got rid of extra variable in Razor2 code. 
	Fixed comment for SEMIFORGED_HOTMAIL_RCVD.

2003-01-16 16:10  felicity

	* masses/mass-check: mass-check now shows status every $updates
	messages and at 100%

2003-01-16 14:42  felicity

	* masses/mass-check: fixed status displays to not give "illegal
	modulus 0" errors on small checks.

2003-01-16 12:06  msquadrat

	* masses/mass-check: Some tweaks to the --mid code (again): Make
	the mid meta RE safe and remove the time part (we don't need to
	create unique MIDs, this is just for logging)

2003-01-16 08:07  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm: remove comment

2003-01-16 07:55  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm, masses/mass-check: fix
	mass-check progress indicator fix mid so it will be consistent

	* rules/25_body_tests_es.cf: New entry

2003-01-15 20:43  jmason

2003-01-15 19:56  jmason

	than expected.

2003-01-15 16:56  felicity

	* masses/rewrite-cf-with-new-scores: rewrite-cf-with-new-scores now

	bug

2003-01-11 21:03  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: EncappedMessage.pm, Message.pm,
	NoMailAudit.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm: Backed out change to not unfold
	headers during encapsulation.  Added a get_pristine_header function
	to try grabbing the correct header out of pristine_headers, and
	then otherwise return the normal get_header answer.

	Michael Moncur)

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: adding in a report header
	shouldn't look for report_header since it doesn't exist anymore... 
	just add it.

2003-01-10 21:59  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: NoMailAudit.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm: perl bug
	1359, we don't want to unfold headers in the report_safe since the
	headers were probably folded for a reason (extra long "To" field
	for instance).	So the report_safe header fields look pretty much
	like they did when they came in.  CVS:

2003-01-05 07:02  felicity

	* Makefile.PL: My previous commit to fix RPM building inadvertantly
	caused installs to non-standard dirs to break.	This adds a new
	INST_SITELIB parameter to Makefile.PL which allows you to set the
	INSTALLSITELIB as replaced in the code if you're installing into
	one area but going to run it out of another (ala: when you do RPM

	install/run out of the same non-standard directory working.

	* rules/: 20_head_tests.cf, 20_meta_tests.cf: Noticed the

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: we should use our functions if

	* masses/mass-check: mass-check results look odd (and get
	misparsed) if we either don't hit any tests or we don't hit any
	meta dependency tests (ie: TESTS='' and META='__FOO', the output
	would be ",__FOO", or "FOO," if the values are flipped...)  This
	makes the end result "__FOO" and "FOO" respectively.

2003-01-04 20:03  felicity

	masses/spamassassin like other local files

2003-01-04 19:56  felicity

2002-12-31 19:37  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: parse eval options at
	parse time instead of run-time (5.5% speed-up)

2002-12-31 19:37  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: change test types to constants
	(odd-numbered ones are now evals too) change some '-' characters in
	option names to '_' characters to be more consistent parse eval
	options at parse time instead of run-time (5.5% speed-up) reorder
	if/elsif during finish_parsing a bit for somewhat better speed
	(order by frequency of test, probably not a noticeable difference)
	use tr// in two places instead of s//

2002-12-31 19:31  quinlan

	* rules/10_misc.cf: change some '-' characters to be '_' for better
	consistency (the majority of usage and examples use _ instead of -
	for the option word separator)

2002-12-30 14:36  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm: Found more "close
	STDIN" statements with the next call too -- replaced as per last
	commit.

2002-12-30 14:34  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm: Fix for bug 1325, we
	don't need to close STDIN so don't. ;) Also, there's a next call
	where there's no context for a next, so perl (5.8.0 at least)
	treats it as a return, so just call return.

2002-12-30 06:08  quinlan

	* rules/20_html_tests.cf: remove HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_14

2002-12-30 01:40  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: the razor2 problem seemed to be
	related to having a dos formatted file.  razor-check doesn't seem
	to have any issues checking it, but through spamassassin, razor
	would see 1 big header.  the solution is to replace the lf/cr/lf
	combo with just lf/lf.	That makes the blank line between header
	and body blank, and razor works nicely for SA then.

2002-12-30 01:15  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: There seem to be sometimes where
	Razor2 doesn't think it gets a request, and therefore doesn't set
	'spam' properly leading to an undefined warning further down the
	code.  Until I can track down the problem, I've put in a kluge
	which basically just sets the result to 0 if it's undefined.

2002-12-30 00:23  quinlan

2002-12-29 05:54  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, rules/20_body_tests.cf,
	rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: generalize most of the
	check_for_mime tests (most of the functions are not needed) add
	T_MIME_DEFICIENT_QP rule (rule I had discarded earlier because it
	did not work well, but should work better now that the MIME QP code
	has been improved, it's also only a few lines of code now) also
	organize the MIME rules a bit

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: Per bug 1316, it looks like
	mutt has a standard format to message-id.  I added a test meta rule
	to look for both the user-agent and message-id headers for
	USER_AGENT.  Also added a forged_mua rule to look for user-agent
	without message-id.  This doesn't score so well, but...

2002-12-27 03:19  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/NoMailAudit.pm: make mass-check 1.85%

	_get_header_list() which we do about 90 times per message

2002-12-27 03:17  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Reworked code of do_meta
	so that meta rules can depend on other meta rules.  The code will
	figure out the dependencies and run the metas in the right order. 
	If a dependency on another meta rule can't be solved (ie: circular
	dependency), the rule is skipped and a debug message is displayed
	(if debugging is enabled).
	
	So: meta BB AA && CC meta AA HEAD1 && CC meta CC HEAD2
	
	Although contrived, the code will make sure to run CC, then AA,
	then BB.
	
	However: meta AA BB meta BB AA
	
	Causes both rules to be skipped.

2002-12-26 23:24  felicity

2002-12-26 10:18  quinlan

	NORMAL_HTTP_TO_IP with T_NORMAL_HTTP_TO_IP_1   add some comments on
	T_ rules - try version of T_BODY_QUOTES test without any single
	quotes - remove rules specific to easmith and quinlan (these were
	produced by   looking at email domain counts from several

2002-12-26 08:54  quinlan

2002-12-25 08:04  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm,
	rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: fix most of my FPs by ignoring
	identical FQHNs for T_SORTED_RECIPIENTS* improving the useful range
	of hits for this test (the same exact FP problem seems to affect
	SUSPICIOUS_RECIPS) also add T_SORTED_RECIPIENTS test for testing
	(an extension of the new suspect recipients code since much of the
	similarity seems to be the result of sorting)

2002-12-25 02:17  quinlan

2002-12-24 21:23  quinlan

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: some final variations on

2002-12-24 20:17  quinlan

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: trim down T_BODY_QUOTES* rules
	to a single rule remove T_NUMERIC_MAILTO_ADDR (hits were really IP
	addresses in http URLs that looked like email addresses) add
	experimental T_NORMAL_HTTP_TO_IP* rules (add T_NUMERIC_MAILTO_ADDR
	hits)

2002-12-24 20:12  quinlan

2002-12-24 05:23  felicity

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: Oops, typos in the new

2002-12-24 04:29  felicity

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: bug 786: DEAR_SOMEBODY and
	DEAR_SOMETHING have a bit of overlap.  Created DEAR_SOMEBODY
	replacement meta rule to see if we can clear it up.  DEAR_SOMEBODY
	has a fairly bad S/O rating anyway, so we may just end up removing
	it.
	
	WEIRD_PORT hits
	http://www.cnn.com:USArticle1840@www.liquidshirts.com/ which
	actually doesn't have a port specified in it.  Put in a possible
	replacement rule to avoid the fps.
	
	bug 1273: the above URL wasn't caught, so I put in a test rule to
	check for a username and/or password in uris.

2002-12-24 02:54  felicity

2002-12-23 22:36  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Thought
	of a new solution to the bayes getting false message-id during
	encapsulated reporting and such -- take the message-id and put it
	in the encapsulated header.  The correct message-id will be used,
	and then pre-learning the message is cleaned as before.

2002-12-23 20:24  felicity

	* rules/: 20_anti_ratware.cf, 20_head_tests.cf, 20_phrases.cf,

	avoiding my fps

2002-12-23 14:09  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Use a private variable to
	set content-description for the mime encapsulated section.  Didn't
	go with my previous commit for some reason. :(

2002-12-23 14:08  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: If you change the content-type or
	content-description of the mime encapsulated spam mail part, you
	need to change it in remove_spamassassin_markup as well.  We don't
	have any other tell-tale markup saying it's an encapsulated
	message, so the code keys in on the two content-* headers.
	
	Added a private configuration setting in SpamAssassin.pm which lets
	us change the description in one place and have it used in
	(de)encapsulation.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: Modified Dns.pm to error out of PTR
	and MX DNS lookups more nicely, ala bug 1270.  Net::DNS sometimes
	dies horribly (if the nameserver(s) listed in resolv.conf don't
	work, for instance,) so is_dns_available will now deal with this
	situation in conjunction with lookup_mx.  lookup_ptr (used by an
	EvalTest) just returns undef which is already an understood return
	value.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm,

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm, lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm,
	rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: Added code to do Razor2 'cf'
	(confidence) range checking.  I'm not sure exactly how it'll
	interact with RAZOR2_CHECK since that should take into account the
	user's min_cf setting, but ...
	
	Remove some useless $fulltext stuff w/ Razor1 and 2 as well (why
	set the variable if you're not going to use it?)
	
	For a random 10 spam sample that I received today:
	
	      8 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_90_100
	      1 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_80_89
	      1 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_00_09
	
	So 80% had a super confidence level, 10% was very high, and 10% was
	very low.
	
	The default for users, BTW, is a min_cf setting of 1.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, masses/mass-check:
	nonsense_from_percent() returned "true" if the names-triplets.txt
	file couldn't be found which is the same as "rule matches".  Change
	it to return "false" instead so we don't FP if we can't read the
	file.
	
	nonsense_from_percent() used rules_filename which isn't likely to
	be set in an actual run.  Converted it to use DEF_RULES_DIR and
	LOCAL_RULES_DIR like the other EvalTests since it's guaranteed to
	be set.
	
	mass-check wasn't setting DEF_RULES_DIR and LOCAL_RULES_DIR (and
	PREFIX) which breaks EvalTests...

	as well

2002-10-16 00:21  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Dns.pm, Reporter.pm: Razor2 calls
	Net::Ping which uses alarm() to timeout.  Unfortunately that kills
	our timeout alarm() for the Razor2 calls.  Doh!  Added in alarms
	after the get_server_info() call (the one that calls Net::Ping) to
	reset our timeout.  It's not great, but I think it'll stop the
	"razor check/report hangs" type problem.

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: I have mailman subscription
	reminders that get flagged with 6-8 points.  This rule should match
	these mails and give it a nice strong negative score.  If we're
	worried about it being abused (since it's a From && Subject rule),
	I can add a body piece pretty easily since there's a standard
	section.  It seemed overkill at the moment.

	addresses.

2002-10-01 20:33  jmason

	* spamproxy/spamproxyd.raw: Patched spamproxyd.raw to specify a
	maximum message size.  The patch and new version wasn't very
	different but the whitespace was all changed around, so it looked
	like a lot more work.  Since so much had been changed already, I
	ran the resulting code through "perltidy -i=2".
	
	I also modified the code to be a bit more efficient:	- instead
	of doing a split(/\r\n/) then adding the \r\n back in,		I
	changed it to split(/^/).   - Code around if/else statements were
	duplicated, so I rewrote	    it to only run the code once.

	Solves the same "{dccproc,pyzor}: command not found" bug when
	people use "spamassassin -r".	- {dcc,pyzor}_report now users
	{dcc,pyzor}_timeout and the configured	{dcc,pyzor}_path instead of
	`{dccproc,pyzor}`  - Minor indentation issue in Reporter.pm  -
	Razor2 reporting now returns a valid return code  -
	{dcc,pyzor}_report should not do open2

2002-09-27 20:40  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: 
	Patch for bug 901.

	user that hasn't upgraded yet.
