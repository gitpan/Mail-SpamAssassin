	Unfortunately, Windows doesn't let you do that.  So we now rename

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm: bug 1664: the
	only entries in the bayes journal are token access time updates
	(from scans).  we can exploit the fact that most of the tokens
	appear multiple times by caching in memory the updates per token,
	then just writing to db the end result times for all tokens.  
	also, scan() tries to opportunistically do a journal sync and
	expire which causes lots of contention if there is a lot of
	messages for a single db (this is usually seen with site-wide dbs).
	 so we flag when we are doing the sync and expire and let all other
	pids not be so opportunistic.  this should greatly lower
	contention.  we also let the db tie r/w happen before we try to
	read from the journal, and also exploit the fact we can open the
	journal before renaming it so the most common error occurs first,
	and then a journal read failure means we don't need to rename the
	temp file back.

	being copied over.  oops.  also added checks for return values to
	make sure we don't delete the journal unless we really should. 
	modified expiry_due to do an expire if the last expire time is >
