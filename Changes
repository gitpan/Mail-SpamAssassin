	* Changes: Updated for 2.54rc1

2003-05-10 18:05  duncf

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: Ready to release?

2003-05-10 17:34  felicity

	* rules/: 20_head_tests.cf, 30_text_de.cf, 30_text_fr.cf,
	30_text_it.cf, 50_scores.cf, 70_broken_rules.cf: bug 1891:
	RCVD_IN_VISI is no longer available

2003-05-09 17:46  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/CmdLearn.pm: bug 1887: sa-learn didn't
	accept parameters to -D

2003-05-09 17:28  felicity

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 1818: spamd fails to create ~/.spamassassin
	when running setuid with sql

2003-05-08 20:59  jmason

	* spamd/libspamc.c: bug 1879: libspamc was closing fds it didn't
	open

2003-05-08 16:28  jmason

	* spamd/: README.spamd, spamc.pod: bug 1799: doco updated to note
	protocol change compared to 2.4x, 2.6x

2003-05-08 14:47  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1869: came up with a
	kluge for the "tokens have 16-bit atime" problem.  if the expire
	code detects that scancount is > 65535, reset all the counters to
	an atime of 0.	it means one expire run doesn't actually expire
	anything, but it should keep the useful tokens around instead of
	the semi-random expire that was occuring in earlier versions.

2003-05-08 14:42  jmason

	* spamd/libspamc.c: bug 1762: sscanf should not use %f due to
	locale issues

2003-05-07 20:41  jmason

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 1802: REPORT_IFSPAM is unhandled if message
	is ham

2003-05-07 16:50  felicity

	* rules/: STATISTICS-set1.txt, STATISTICS-set2.txt,
	STATISTICS-set3.txt, STATISTICS.txt: bug 1589: generated
	STATISTICS* files for the new GA run

2003-05-07 15:23  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: bug 1868:
	X-Spam-Checker-Version may or may not have parens depending on if
	the message was considered spam or not.  Just add in the parens...

2003-05-07 13:06  jmason

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 1725: spamd taint mode problem with ARGV
	fixed

2003-05-07 05:38  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1782: a potential but in
	stdio could cause journal data to be corrupted by multiple writes
	to the same area of the journal.  switch to using syswrite()
	instead of just print (stdio) to help address this issue.

2003-05-06 23:26  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1860: Bayes was not using
	hapaxes

2003-05-06 06:14  felicity

	* rules/: 20_meta_tests.cf, 50_scores.cf: bug 1589: spammers have
	been targeting our nice rules to get themselves negative overall
	scores.  ran the GA again to lower the nice rule scores.  this
	should help deal with the forgeries.  also added a "TOO_MANY_MUA"
	rule that will catch when multiple USER_AGENT rules hit.

2003-05-01 23:25  jmason

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 1799: REPORT should use local report
	template, not default

2003-05-01 23:19  jmason

	* sa-learn.raw, spamassassin.raw: bug 1737: Bayes doco improved

2003-04-23 21:48  felicity

	* t/spamd_utf8.t: bug 1708: UTF-8 locale was specified incorrectly
	(glibc version)

2003-04-22 05:14  felicity

	* USAGE: bug 1739: USAGE file says that a test message will have
	the subject rewritten, but rewrite_subject is off by default in
	2.5x.  change the docs to reflect this.

2003-04-22 05:00  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1706: fixed a small
	issue where the code was expecting a shift but got a pop, so we
	need to look at the end of the array, not the beginning. :(

2003-04-22 04:54  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1706: when bayes was
	expiring tokens, it would check to see if there were enough tokens
	left at the end and reprieve tokens if necessary.  however, the
	reprieval was happening in a random order, so the oldest tokens
	would likely be left in the DB.  the code will now sort the tokens
	by atime and reprieval the most recently used tokens first.

2003-04-19 12:35  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: bug 1800: messages with
	large positive scores (if they hit GTUBE at 1000 points for
	instance), can have a X-Spam-Level header with more than the RFC
	allowed number of chars.  so we now limit X-Spam-Level to show a
	max score of 100.  that makes it obvious the message is really spam
	while staying RFC compliant.

2003-04-10 08:27  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm: bug 1524: EvalTests looking
	for/storing IPs would sometimes catch extra chars that occur around
	the IP address (such as [ in Received headers).  Use a new regexp
	to only match IP addresses.

2003-04-06 18:29  felicity

	* spamd/utils.c: bug 1755: a c++ comment slipped in, and some
	compilers don't know what to do with it.

2003-04-06 12:56  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Util.pm: bug 1741: allow ~ and space in
	file path (good for Windows), return blank if blank passed in,
	fixed return only if RE matches

2003-04-05 11:36  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/CmdLearn.pm: bug 1691: sa-learn was sending
	non-error output to stderr instead of stdout (specifically the
	"Learned # messages" string)

2003-04-03 17:48  duncf

	* debian/: changelog.in, control, logcheck, spamassassin.default,
	spamassassin.templates, watch, po/POTFILES.in, po/pt_BR.po,
	po/templates.pot: Updated debian packaging for CVS builds; adds
	po-debconf support

2003-04-03 17:48  felicity

	* spamassassin.spec: updated spec file since 2.51 prepared for 2.54
	release

2003-04-03 17:34  jmason

	* build/preprocessor.pm: backport: preprocessor being indexed by
	CPAN, avoid for next version

2003-04-03 17:33  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: Starting 2.54

2003-03-31 17:42  jmason

	* Changes, build/README, lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: ready
	for release

2003-03-31 16:43  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1689: exists method does
	not exist in NDBM_File for some reason.  worked around

2003-03-31 16:08  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: moved dialup_codes into more
	privileged area

2003-03-29 19:26  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: ready to release

2003-03-29 17:42  felicity

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, t/SATest.pm, t/rule_tests.t,
	t/zz_cleanup.t: bug 1703: Makefile.PL would set a razor1 test if
	razor1 wasn't installed.  rule_tests.t was still trying to use
	bytes.pm.  spamd tests were using user's preferences/bayes/etc.

2003-03-29 17:28  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1707: When syncing the
	journal, the code took advantage of a UNIX-ism where you can open a
	file, then rename it, and still access the file data. 
	Unfortunately, Windows doesn't let you do that.  So we now rename
	before we open, and add a "can we read the file" check beforehand
	to avoid messy cleanup.

2003-03-29 17:10  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1699: a slight change to the
	last patch, during tokenization, strip the extra chars before
	skipping magic tokens.

2003-03-28 13:28  jmason

	* MANIFEST, spamd/libspamc.c, spamd/libspamc.h, t/spamc_B.t,
	t/data/spam/bsmtp: bug 1595: BSMTP mode (spamc -B) fixed

2003-03-28 12:26  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm: bug 1699:
	slightly better regex.	ignore actual magic token strings, not just
	magic token prefixes.  this leaves more tokens able to be used.

2003-03-28 12:14  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm: Bug 1699: The
	code wasn't protecting the Bayes DB "magic" tokens (tracks num
	ham/spam, etc.) from being overwritten if they occured in a
	message.  This allows mails to corrupt the DB either maliciously or
	if they discuss the tokens.

2003-03-27 22:41  jmason

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm,
	SpamAssassin/CmdLearn.pm, SpamAssassin/DBBasedAddrList.pm,
	SpamAssassin/Locker.pm, SpamAssassin/UnixLocker.pm,
	SpamAssassin/Win32Locker.pm: bug 1690: now has different lock
	timeouts for different bayes operations

2003-03-27 19:25  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1696: you could continuously
	"forget" tokens from messages you've learned, and even those you
	hadn't learned.

2003-03-27 19:18  felicity

	* spamassassin.raw, t/reportheader.t: bug 1695: report_header was
	removed in 2.5x but still was in the POD docs and a test config.

2003-03-27 19:16  felicity

	* sa-learn.raw: bug 1502: sa-learn wasn't paying attention to the
	compile-time paths for rules and the like.  The problem was that
	the variables were declared my() which aren't accessible by other
	packages.

2003-03-27 17:27  jmason

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm,
	SpamAssassin/CmdLearn.pm, SpamAssassin/Conf.pm,
	SpamAssassin/DBBasedAddrList.pm, SpamAssassin/Locker.pm,
	SpamAssassin/UnixLocker.pm, SpamAssassin/Win32Locker.pm: backing
	out lock_timeout patch for redo

2003-03-27 17:01  jmason

	SpamAssassin/CmdLearn.pm, SpamAssassin/Conf.pm,
	SpamAssassin/DBBasedAddrList.pm, SpamAssassin/Locker.pm,
	SpamAssassin/UnixLocker.pm, SpamAssassin/Win32Locker.pm: bug 1690:
	now has different lock timeouts for different bayes operations

2003-03-27 16:27  jmason

	* spamassassin.raw: bug 1608: spamassassin.1 lists incorrect paths
	for config files

2003-03-27 16:15  jmason

	* spamd/: libspamc.c, spamc.c, spamc.pod: bug 1697: spamc fails to
	dump message when running out of memory

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 1536: kernel reporting SIGWAIT problem on
	recent Red Hat kernels

2003-03-27 13:13  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/DBBasedAddrList.pm: bug 1661: user_prefs
	was world-writable after AWL tie, due to failure to set umask
	correctly

2003-03-27 13:12  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm: bug 1401: check_rbl was
	checking incorrect number of Received hdrs

2003-03-27 12:35  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Dns.pm, Reporter.pm: bug 1632: Razor
	modifies %ENV so we tried to use a local() to make a temp version,
	which works, but kills %ENV for the Razor code as well.  So now
	we'll let the helper_mode functions handle backing up/restoring
	%ENV as appropriate.

2003-03-27 09:55  felicity

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 1514: spamd was trying to use "../lib" which
	is ok most of the time, but during a "make test" on perl 5.005 it
	errored out with the "bytes.pm" error.	so we now check for a
	"../blib/lib" first and use it if it exists.  otherwise, we
	continue with "../lib".

2003-03-27 09:48  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: bug 1685: we should clean PATH when we
	start if we're in taint mode.  This fixes a Sys::Hostname problem
	in 5.005, but it's a good idea anyway since we won't be able to use
	PATH unless it's cleaned in taint mode anyway.

2003-03-26 17:53  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: bug 1630: add-all-addrs-to-blacklist
	was a no-op, due to > vs >= bug

2003-03-26 12:18  jmason

	* sa-learn.raw, lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/CmdLearn.pm: bug 1572:
	sa-learn doco was still talking about auto-whitelists, although
	this was never implemented

2003-03-26 12:08  jmason

	* spamd/README.spamd: bug 1674: README.spamd didn't know that
	auto-learning had been implemented

2003-03-26 12:06  jmason

	* MANIFEST.SKIP: updated MANIFEST.SKIP likewise

2003-03-26 12:05  jmason

2003-03-26 10:20  msquadrat

	* configure, Makefile.PL, .cvsignore: bug 1542: configure wasn't
	updated, so the fix for this bug didn't work per default

2003-03-24 17:22  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: 2.53 devel cycle started

2003-03-24 13:11  msquadrat

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 1601: option --syslog-socket wasn't
	implemented

2003-03-23 17:10  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm: bug 1664: the
	only entries in the bayes journal are token access time updates
	(from scans).  we can exploit the fact that most of the tokens
	appear multiple times by caching in memory the updates per token,
	then just writing to db the end result times for all tokens.  
	also, scan() tries to opportunistically do a journal sync and
	expire which causes lots of contention if there is a lot of
	messages for a single db (this is usually seen with site-wide dbs).
	 so we flag when we are doing the sync and expire and let all other
	pids not be so opportunistic.  this should greatly lower
	contention.  we also let the db tie r/w happen before we try to
	read from the journal, and also exploit the fact we can open the
	journal before renaming it so the most common error occurs first,
	and then a journal read failure means we don't need to rename the
	temp file back.

2003-03-23 16:52  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1672: a typo in a backported
	patch for 2.51 caused bayes to sometimes not unlock the db.

2003-03-20 12:31  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: 2.51 devel cycle started

	--force-rebuild doco is unclear. fixed

2003-03-19 22:51  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: trivial documentation correction

2003-03-19 14:26  msquadrat

	* Makefile.PL: bug 1652: Perl 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 ship different
	versions of ExtUtils::MakeMaker; both carry the version 5.45 though

2003-03-19 11:29  felicity

	* Makefile.PL: bug 1652: the suggested patch doesn't work.  perl
	5.6.0 and perl 5.6.1 both have EU:MM 5.45, but the one in 5.6.1 has
	PM_FILTER.  so reverting the initial patch since it doesn't take
	this into account.

2003-03-18 21:27  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1655: we tie to check # of
	Bayes tokens, but we don't untie if # ham/spam is too low.  fixed.

2003-03-18 20:52  jmason

	* MANIFEST: bug 1541: removed trim_bayes_db from distro

2003-03-18 18:38  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1636: incorrect errors
	from bayes if an error occurred during big scan-counter increment

2003-03-18 17:56  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1626: if a token's atime
	in the bayes db is > current scan count, there was an expiry error,
	so we'll reset the atime to the last expire time.

2003-03-18 15:13  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Conf.pm,

2003-03-18 14:11  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm,
	SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm, SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: bug 1566:
	if spamd is run with -x, spamd only ties the Bayes DBs once, so SA
	doesn't detect when nspam/nham have gone over the min # required
	(200) and enable automatically.

2003-03-18 14:04  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1579: there were several
	undef warnings in the Bayes code.  cleaned that out.

2003-03-18 13:58  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm:
	bug 1556: PerMsgStatus wasn't cleaning up bayes DB ties after it
	was done scanning which caused problems with MailScanner.

2003-03-18 13:55  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: bug 1653: HTML tests had undef
	warnings sometimes.  do better parsing via RE.

2003-03-17 19:27  felicity

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 1640: spamd was sending the Content-Length
	header instead of the Spam: header for protocol 1.2 clients.  it
	should have been sending just the Spam header, not the
	Content-Length one.

2003-03-17 19:21  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: bug 1648: unwhitelist_from_rcvd
	was non-functional due to typo.  also updated some docs.

2003-03-17 19:14  felicity

	* Makefile.PL: bug 1652: we checked for version < 5.45, but the
	feature was added > 5.45, so we get confused when == 5.45.

2003-03-17 11:07  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1651: if for some reason a
	Bayes scan() doesn't occur (too few tokens, tokens without enough
	probability, etc,) but the DBs were already tied, we didn't untie
	them.

2003-03-17 07:24  felicity

	* sa-learn.raw, spamassassin.raw, spamd/spamc.pod: bug 1605: SA
	documentation ought to specify what "ham" is for people who don't
	necessarily know it means non-spam.

2003-03-17 07:19  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm,
	SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: fix for
	bug 1591:  Bayes is_available() didn't pay attention to use_bayes,
	so it would still attempt a tie and possibly create DBs even if it
	wasn't going to use the bayes stuff.  renamed the function to
	is_scan_available() since other modules call it to see if a scan
	would be done (determining scoreset, etc.)  cleaned up scan() a
	little (let is_scan_available check for # of tokens)

2003-03-17 07:12  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: fix for bug 1610: after a
	bayes expire, the current message scan count would return to 0. 
	this is because the magic token in the db (scancount_base) wasn't
	being copied over.  oops.  also added checks for return values to
	make sure we don't delete the journal unless we really should. 
	modified expiry_due to do an expire if the last expire time is >
	current message scan.  this should never happen in actual usage and
	only appears if this bug has occured.
