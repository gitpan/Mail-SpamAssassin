DESCRIPTION
    SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam using text
    analysis.

    Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on
    mail headers and body text to identify "spam", also known as
    unsolicited commercial email.

    Once identified, the mail is then tagged as spam for later
    filtering using the user's own mail user-agent application.

    SpamAssassin also includes support for reporting spam messages
    to collaborative filtering databases, such as Vipul's Razor (
    http://razor.sourceforge.net/ ).

    The default tagging operations that take place are detailed in
    the the TAGGING manpage section below.

OPTIONS
    -P  Normally SpamAssassin will write the rewritten message to the
        mail spool by default. The `-P' parameter will cause it to
        pipe the output to STDOUT instead.

    -t  Test mode.

    -r  Report this message as verified spam. This will submit the mail
        message read from STDIN to various spam-blocker databases,
        such as Vipul's Razor ( http://razor.sourceforge.net/ ).

        If the message contains SpamAssassin markup, this will be
        stripped out automatically before submission.

    -c config
        Read configuration from `config'. The default configuration
        file, if this is not specified, is
        `$Config{installsitelib}/spamassassin.cf'.

    -p prefs
        Read user score preferences from `prefs'. The default
        preferences file, if this is not specified, is
        `~/.spamassassin.cf'.

TAGGING FOR SPAM MAILS
    The modifications made are as follows:

    Subject: header
        The string `*****SPAM*****' is prepended to the subject.

    X-Spam-Status: header
        A string, `Yes, hits=nn required=nn' is set in this header
        to reflect the filter status.

    X-Spam-Flag: header
        Set to `YES'.

    Content-Type: header
        Set to `text/plain', in order to defang HTML mail or other
        active content that could "call back" to the spammer.

    spam mail body text
        The SpamAssassin report is added to top of the mail message
        body.

TAGGING FOR NON-SPAM MAILS
    X-Spam-Status: header
        A string, `No, hits=nn required=nn' is set in this header to
        reflect the filter status.

INSTALLATION
    The spamassassin command is part of the Mail::SpamAssassin Perl
    module. Install this as a normal Perl module, using `perl -MCPAN
    -e shell', or by hand.

ENVIRONMENT
    No environment variables, aside from those used by perl, are
    required to be set.
