NAME
    spamc - client for spamd

SYNOPSIS
    spamc [-d host] [-p port] [-s max_size] [-u username] [-h] [-f]
OPTIONS
    -d *host*
        Connect to spamd server on given host

    -f  Cause spamc to safe-failover if it can't connect to spamd -- what
        this means is that in case spamc fails to connect to spamd, it will
        not return with an exitcode set, it will instead dump the original
        message to stdout, allowing the message to be delivered, albeit
        unscanned for spam. Without this flag, connection failures to spamd
        will cause message delivery failures. Even with this flag set
        however, if spamc connects successfully, and then encounters an
        error at a later stage of communication, it will still return an
        exitcode.

    -h  Print this help message and terminate without action

    -p *port*
        Connect to spamd server listening on given port

    -s *max_size*
        Set the maximum message size which will be sent to spamd -- any
        bigger than this threshold and the message will be returned
        unprocessed. Note that the default size is 250k, so if spamc gets
        handed a message bigger than this, it won't be passed to spamd. The
        size is specified in bytes, and if you send it a negative number,
        things are quite likely to break very hard.

    -u *username*
        This argument has been obsoleted. To have spamd use per-user-config
        files, run spamc as the user whose config files spamd should load.

DESCRIPTION
    Spamc is the client half of the spamc/spamd pair. It should be used in
    place of `spamassassin -P' in scripts to process mail. It will read the
    mail from stdin, and spool it to its connection to spamd, then read the
    result back and print it to stdout. Spamc has extremely low overhead in
    loading, so it should be much faster to load than the whole spamassassin
    program.

    See the README file in the spamd directory of the SpamAssassin
    distribution for more details.
