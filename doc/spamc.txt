DESCRIPTION
    Spamc is the client half of the spamc/spamd pair. It should be used in
    place of `spamassassin -P' in scripts to process mail. It will read the
    mail from stdin, and spool it to its connection to spamd, then read the
    result back and print it to stdout. Spamc has extremely low overhead in
    loading, so it should be much faster to load than the whole spamassassin
    program.

    See the README file in the spamd directory of the SpamAssassin
    distribution for more details.
