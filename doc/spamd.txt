NAME
    spamd - daemonized version of spamassassin

SYNOPSIS
    spamd [options]

OPTIONS
    -c  Create user preferences files if they don't exist (default: don't)

    -d  Detach from starting process and run in background (daemonize)

    -D  Print debugging messages

    -h  Print a brief help message, then exit without further action

    -L  Perform only local tests on all mail. In other words, skip DNS and
        other network tests. Works the same as the `-L' flag to
        `spamassassin(1)'

    -A *host,...*
        Specify a list of authorized hosts which can connect to this spamd
        instance. The list is one of valid IP addresses, separated by
        commas. By default, connections are only accepted from localhost

    -p *port*
        Optionally specifies the port number for the server to listen on.

    -P  Die on user errors (for the user passed from spamc) instead of
        falling back to user *nobody* and using the default configuration

    -s *facility*
        Specify the syslog facility to use (default: mail)

    -u *username*
        Run as the named user. The alternative, default behaviour is to
        setuid() to the user running `spamc', if `spamd' is running as root

    -x  Turn off per-user config files. All users will just get the default
        configuration

DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of this program is to provide a daemonized version of the
    spamassassin executable. The goal is improving throughput performance
    for automated mail checking.

    This is intended to be used alongside `spamc', a fast, low-overhead C
    client program.

    See the README file in the `spamd' directory of the SpamAssassin
    distribution for more details.
