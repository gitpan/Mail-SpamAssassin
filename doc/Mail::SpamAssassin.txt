NAME
    Mail::SpamAssassin - Mail::Audit spam detector plugin

SYNOPSIS
      my $spamtest = new Mail::SpamAssassin();
      my $mail = Mail::Audit->new();

      my $status = $spamtest->check ($mail);
      if ($status->is_spam ()) {
        $status->rewrite_mail ();
        $mail->accept("caught_spam");
      }
      ...

DESCRIPTION
    Mail::SpamAssassin is a Mail::Audit plugin to identify spam
    using text analysis.

    Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on
    mail headers and body text to identify "spam", also known as
    unsolicited commercial email.

    Once identified, the mail can then be optionally tagged as spam
    for later filtering using the user's own mail user-agent
    application.

    This module implements a Mail::Audit plugin, allowing
    SpamAssassin to be used in a Mail::Audit filter. In addition, a
    command-line filter tool is also provided.

METHODS
    $f = new Mail::SpamAssassin( [ { opt => val, ... } ] )
        Constructs a new `Mail::SpamAssassin' object. You may pass
        the following attribute-value pairs to the constructor.

    rules_filename
            The filename to load spam-identifying rules from.
            (optional)

    userprefs_filename
            The filename to load preferences from. (optional)

    config_text
            The text of all rules and preferences. If you prefer not
            to load the rules from files, read them in yourself and
            set this instead. This is optional, but note that at
            least one of `rules_filename', `userprefs_filename' or
            `config_text' must be specified to provide
            configuration, otherwise SpamAssassin will not do
            anything!

    $status = $f->check ($mail)
        Check a mail, encapsulated in a `Mail::Audit' object, to
        determine if it is spam or not.

        Returns a `Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus' object which
        can be used to test or manipulate the mail message.

        Note that the `Mail::SpamAssassin' object can be re-used for
        further messages without affecting this check; in OO
        terminology, the `Mail::SpamAssassin' object is a "factory".

    $f->report_as_spam ($mail)
        Report a mail, encapsulated in a `Mail::Audit' object, as
        human-verified spam. This will submit the mail message to
        live, collaborative, spam-blocker databases, allowing other
        users to block this message.
