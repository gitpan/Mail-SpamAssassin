# First of all, the generally useful stuff; thresholds and the whitelist
# of addresses which, for some reason or another, often trigger false
# positives.

required_hits		5
auto_report_threshold	30

# Whitelist and blacklist addresses are *not* patterns; they're just normal
# strings.  one exception is that "*@isp.com" is allowed.  They should be in
# lower-case.  You can either add multiple addrs on one line,
# whitespace-separated, or you can use multiple lines.
#
# Monty Solomon: he posts from an ISP that has often been the source of spam
# (no fault of his own ;), and sometimes uses Bcc: when mailing.

whitelist_from		monty@roscom.com

# Add your blacklist entries in the same format...
#
# blacklist_from	friend@public.com

# Mail using languages used in these country codes will not be marked
# as being possibly spam in a foreign language.

# By default, the subject lines of suspected spam will be tagged.
# This can be disabled here.
#
# rewrite_subject 0

# By default, spamassassin will include its report in the body
# of suspected spam. Enabling this causes the report to go in the
# headers instead. Using 'use_terse_report' for this is recommended.
#
# report_header 1

# By default, SpamAssassin uses a fairly long report format.
# Enabling this uses a shorter format which includes all the
# information in the normal one, but without the superfluous
# explanations.
#
# use_terse_report 0

# By default, spamassassin will change the Content-type: header of
# suspected spam to "text/plain". This is a safety feature. If you
# prefer to leave the Content-type header alone, set this to 0.
#
# defang_mime 0

# By default, SpamAssassin will run RBL checks.  If your ISP already
# does this, set this to 1.
#
# skip_rbl_checks 1
