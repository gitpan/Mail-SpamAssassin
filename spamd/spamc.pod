=head1 DESCRIPTION

Spamc is the client half of the spamc/spamd pair.  It should be used in place
of C<spamassassin -P> in scripts to process mail.  It will read the mail from
stdin, and spool it to its connection to spamd, then read the result back and
print it to stdout.  Spamc has extremely low overhead in loading, so it should
be much faster to load than the whole spamassassin program.

See the F<README> file in the F<spamd> directory of the SpamAssassin distribution
for more details.
