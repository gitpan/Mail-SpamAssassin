# Default whitelists.  These should be addresses which send mail that is often
# tagged (incorrectly) as spam; it also helps that they be addresses of big
# companies with lots of lawyers, so if spammers impersonate them, they'll get
# into big trouble, so it doesn't provide a shortcut around SpamAssassin.
#
# Whitelist and blacklist addresses are now file-glob-style patterns, so
# "friend@somewhere.com", "*@isp.com", or "*.domain.net" will all work.
