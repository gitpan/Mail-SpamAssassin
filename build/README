SPAMASSASSIN DEVELOPMENT SNAPSHOT PROCEDURE
===========================================

- cd to the directory for the codebase you want the devel tree to
  come from

- run "./build/update_devel" to build the tar.gz files

- by default, they're written to ~/spamassassin.taint.org/devel/ .  This
  Works For Me (tm), as it's my local cvs checkout of the SpamAssassin
  website.  Copy them to wherever you want, yourself.


SPAMASSASSIN RELEASE PROCEDURE
==============================

- cd to the directory for the codebase you want the release to
  come from

- edit lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm and comment the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD
  line.

- cvs commit -m "ready to release"

- run "./build/update_stable" to build the tar.gz files

- by default, they're written to ~/spamassassin.taint.org/released/ .
  This Works For Me (tm), as it's my local cvs checkout of the
  SpamAssassin website.  Copy them to wherever you want, yourself.

- test the tar.gz and zip files!  redo until they work!! ;)

- CVS tag the release files:

        cvs tag spamassassin_release_X_Y_Z

  (where X_Y_Z == 2_4_0 or whatever version you're working on.)

- Now, start the new development codebase.  For minor updates of a 2.x
  tree (e.g. 2.x.1, 2.x.2), you don't need to branch; for major updates
  (2.x.0) you should use a new development branch, off HEAD.

        TODO: command to do this

- In the new development codeline, edit lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm, bump the
  $VERSION line to the correct version, and uncomment the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD
  line.

- then, commit the new version number to the new branch:

        cvs commit -m "starting new release track"
