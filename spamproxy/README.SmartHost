This package contains the Mail::SpamAssassin::SMTP::SmartHost module which is
based upon the Net::SMTP::Server::Relay module from MacGyver's
Net::SMTP::Server package (http://www.macgyver.org/software/perl/).

The module is covered by the same license by which Net::SMTP::Server is
covered.

Hopefully, this will be of some use.
