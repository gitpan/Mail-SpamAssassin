TODO (ALTERNATIVE UI'S)
-----------------------

- Make it windows-friendly, esp. for integration with Outlook etc. This should
  be possible, using MAPI to access and rewrite the messages (volunteers needed
  for this one!)

- Provide an interface for use on a system-wide basis, integrating it with the
  MTA.  This should be easy enough, if the overhead of forking a perl
  interpreter per-message is acceptable.

- For systems with a high mail volume, this overhead may be too high.  In this
  case, provide a POE-based daemon which processes messages, and a low-overhead
  C client which provides the interface to that daemon.

- For POP users, write a POE-based daemon which allows POP users to connect and
  retrieve their mail from their ISP, with spam filtering provided by
  SpamAssassin.  In effect, this is a spam-filtering POP proxy.



TODO (BETTER SPAM-BLOCKING)
---------------------------

- Add ban-file support

- Add a whitelist system (cf. mjd's site) for "public" addresses
