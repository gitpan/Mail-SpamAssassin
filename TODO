TODO (ALTERNATIVE UI'S)
-----------------------

- Make it windows-friendly, esp. for integration with Outlook etc. This should
  be possible, using MAPI to access and rewrite the messages (volunteers needed
  for this one!)

- For POP users, write a POE-based daemon which allows POP users to connect and
  retrieve their mail from their ISP, with spam filtering provided by
  SpamAssassin.  In effect, this is a spam-filtering POP proxy.



TODO (BETTER SPAM-BLOCKING)
---------------------------

- Add ban-file support

- Add a whitelist system (cf. mjd's site) for "public" addresses
